# [Sculptor][ProjectLink] - the smart delivery service

## Project Overview 📑
**Sculptor** is a Web Application API designed for a **delivery scheduling system** that supports three distinct types of users: *Admin*, *Retailer*, and *Deliverer*. The system aims to streamline the delivery process, enhance efficiency, and reduce carbon footprint by optimizing delivery routes and schedules.

### The Retailer side 📦
Retailer users, typically in-person workers at stores, are responsible for creating and managing orders. The process involves:

1. **Order Creation**: Retailers collect product information from customers using an EAN (European Article Number).

2. **Delivery Date**: Once an order is created, the system provides a delivery date.

3. **Daily Summary**: At the end of each workday, customers receive an email with the exact delivery time for their products.

### The Deliverer side 🚚
Deliverers receive their schedules daily in a tabular format, enabling them to:

1. **Check Orders**: View and manage the orders assigned to them for delivery.

2. **Optimized Routing**: Orders are grouped by delivery areas to minimize carbon emissions and fuel costs.

3. **Delivery Confirmation**: Customers are notified via email when their orders are delivered.

### The Admin side 🛠️
Admins have the highest level of control within the system, enabling them to:

1. **User Management**: Create, update, and delete user accounts for retailers and deliverers.

2. **Order Oversight**: Monitor all orders within the system and ensure smooth operation.

## Used Technologies ⚙️
