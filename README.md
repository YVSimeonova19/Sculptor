# [Sculptor][ProjectLink] - the smart delivery service

<img align="right" alt="logo" src="#">

## Project resume 📑
This is a Web Application API for a **delivery scheduling system** with 3 different types of users - *Admin*, *Retailer* and *Deliverer*.

### The retailer side 📦
A reatiler user is intended to be an in-person worker at a store. They take an order from a customer by collecting information about he products by an EAN. When the order is created a delivery date is returned. At the end of the work day, the clients are emailed the exact time they will recieve their products.

### The deliverer side 🚚
A deliverer gets their schedule every day as a table, where they can check orders they have delivered. All the orders are grouped by the area they will be delivered to - that means less carbon waste and less fuel expenses. Clients recieve an email when their order gets delivered.
